Due to the online nature of the class last week I was unable to speak directly with anyone about their mod jam. So I have no insight on their code.

Norah:
    Norah's mod jam is unbelievably charming. She custom made all her art and assets. The frog, the background, the user interface, all of it is gorgeous pixel art.
    She incorporated a minor animation when the frog shoots out its tongue, which alongside the music, sound effects and custom art style, gives the game a lot
    of charm and character. She worked in a new method that operates the tongues movement. I believe Norah used the lerp function to move the frog's tongue to
    cursor's position then pulling it back slowly to the origin point as long as the mouse button is being pressed down. It feels a little wonky, as the tongue
    will be unresponsive if the player makes successive clicks far apart. I also noticed that the tongue and the mechanic that catches the flies are not one to one,
    as flies can be caught even when the tongue is retracted. There is also no integrated way to play again when the game terminates internally. whether the player
    wins or loses, the only way to replay the game is to refresh the page. Also, the music suddenly stops when the game ends, which is perfectly fine but for my own
    personal taste I sure do wish those calm gaming tunes would keep playing and looping as I ready myself to catch even more flies! 

    Despite these minor flaws and bugs, Norah's game is far too cute to not love. The little frog is absolutely adorable... But imagine if the frog wore a hat, now
    that would be pretty fly! (Norah played around with the idea of giving the frog changeable hats)

Ben:
    Ben's mod jam immediately stood out due to the added mechanic of an enemy. The player is not only trying to catch flies, but they must actively prevent the glutinous
    hypno toad from eating too many flies first. Ben did a great job with his mod jam, as it not only feels flawless, but he also managed to give the game a real retro
    arcade feel to it. The pixel font, the title screen, and the fast paced quick gameplay really capture the retro vibe. I also feel like I have to slot in a quarter for
    every replay. Speaking of replay, Ben made sure to add a play again function which allows the player to instantly jump back into game if the want another chance at out
    munching the hypno toad. Ben has a fun background made up of large leaves. Ben actually coded the leaves directly in, he did not import the background, nor did he import
    assets for the player frog, hypno toad, or even the butterflies. To me this is super impressive, as it is far easier to create the assets outside of P5 and import them in.
    I tip my hat to Ben for this impressive feat, which in turn makes his game load extremely quickly as very few assets must be loaded into the browser.

Ray:
    First and foremost, Ray's game looks incredibly clean. It has a very appealing minimalist quality to it. The lack of shading, rounded corners, simplified font, and
    geometric shapes give the entire project a clean and sharp look which I really really enjoy. A+ for style. The gameplay itself is also just as solid. ray built up from
    the given frogfrogfrog game by adding a jump mechanic. The player can still shoot out the frog's tongue, but they can also jump between a series of lily pads. This may not
    have been intentional, but because the frog's tongue is always loaded, the player can actually jump directly into a fly instead of shooting out the tongue. Regardless of
    intention, this adds a lot of depth to the gameplay, essentially letting players choose how they wish to play as you can easily fill up the meter without shooting the tongue
    even once. Ray also has this floating effect on some of the lily pads which is a nice touch. I noticed a small bug, when the frog is standing on the top lily pad, if the
    The player clicks repeatedly on it and the frog will continuously jump, essentially allowing it to float. This doesn't happen on the other 2 lily pads.
    A minor nitpick: due to how fly generation was handled, if the player stands on the top lily pad they will eventually win without doing anything. This could be avoided by
    adding a game over condition. But hey, Ray managed to load in an array of flies, which I did not manage to do. Overall, lovely work from Ray.
