1. The tongue has physics
    The tongue could follow the mouse and flail around. Perhaps it bounces off the walls and such.

2. The fly is eating the frog
    we play as the fly but keep the fly movement just to change the perspective of the game. Instead of a still frog trying to catch a moving fly, we are a moving fly trying to consume the frog.

3. The fly cannot be eaten
    We control the fly and are desperately trying to avoid the frog's tongue. Frog could move around trying to catch us shooting out its tongue at random intervals.

4. The frog gets fat.
    As the frog eats more flies, it gets sluggish and slow. making catching subsequent flie progressively harder.

5. The frog has to not starve
    The frog has a hunger meter, and if too much time passes without the player eating a fly, the frog starves to death

6. The fly is trying to get eaten
    The frog is allergic to flies, but the fly is trying to get consumed. The frog's tongue is constantly out and the fly is trying to reach it so it can finally be muched.

7. The fly has friends
    There are many flies? 

8. Many frogs fighting for the fly
    There could be other NPC frogs that the player has to fight for the chance to eat the fly. Tongus could have colission.

9. The are bad flies
    add more flies and mix hornets into the equation. Eating the hornets is very bad and hurts the frog.

10. The frog gets tired
    Using the tongue too much slows the frog down. Something bad happens when we miss a fly to punish the player for missing its delicious treat.

11. The frog's tongue doesn't listen
    The fro could be in the center of the screen on a lilypad and the tongue shoots in the oposite direction of the mouse.

12. The tongue is invisible
    The froge is invisible, and so is the cursor. The tongue only appears when it is shot out. Making this far more difficult and frustrating, having to rely on the previous known position of the tongue to locate our frog.

14. The frog can move around freely
    The frog can move around the screen with the arrow keys, but its tongue has very limited reach. forcing the player to move closer to each fly so they can catch them.

15. The frog is trying to eat the fly while a snake is frying to eat the frog.
    The frog is in the middle of the screen, but locked to the x-axis. above us is the tasty fly, but below us is a ravenous snake that would follow us and threaten to jump out and snatch up our cute little frog butt.

16. Tongue leaves behind a trail of sticky mucus
    The tongue could leave behind sticky mucus which could slow down the flies, giving us a tactial advantage over these pesky flies.

17. The frog can critically strike the fly destroying it
    We could add power ups to the frog's tongue. Some good some back. Fire tongue that burns the fly, vaccuum that sucks in the fly, critical strike mechanic where our tongue strikes so powerfully the fly is destroyed.

18. The tongue can be charged to shoot faster
    Holding down the mouse button would charge the tongue but slow down the frog's movement. The longer we hold, the more power and the faster the tongue shoots out.

19. The fly has spicy dance moves
    The fly could move around in confusing patterns alongside some fun colorful lights and a disco ball? the frog is on the disco ball?

20. The tongue has a lilipop hotbox
    eating flies gives us points, which we can spend on power ups. Sticky tongue, or a large hitbox on the tip of the tongue.

21. The area is a pond
    The frog is swimming around trying to eat flies on the surface of the water. Maybe it's too different from base game.

22. there are also spiders
    Spiders crawl along the screen also trying to eat the fly. Eating the spiders is not good... or maybe it is? perhaps eating the spider allows more flies to spawn.

24. The frog has to stay hydrated
    There could be a hydration meter that depletes, so every so often the frog must retreat to its pond to moisturize. maybe being dehydrated makes the tongue unbarebly slow.

25. The frog is allergic to flies
    Eating flies actually hurts the frog. But how can the frog help it? Flies are so tasty.

27. The fly fights back
    add a quick time event style mechanic after catching the fly. It tries to break free, so the player must click many times to reel the fly in. Like a fishing minigame.

28. Frog moves to the flies location after eating
    after latching onto the fly, the frog pulls itself to the flies location to eat it. The frog remains there, but new flies spawn in different areas after the frog has moved.
