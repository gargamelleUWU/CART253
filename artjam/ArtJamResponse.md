Let me start by stating how incredibly diverse and creative all the Art Jam assignments were. I was absolutely blown away by some of the assignments I saw. Some people displayed impressive technical skills that really shined through the intricacies and complexity of their assignments. Others showed amazing creative skills and innovative thinking. 

Dylan’s Art Jam blew me away instantly. Dylan created a lovely scene that used not only complex visual objects such as trees and mountains, but also simulated a panning effect by parallaxing his individual background layers. He made ample use of randomized generation with said trees and stars that blaze the night sky. On top of this already visually stunning scene, he added a mouse element that shoots a meteor shower at the click of a button. This Art Jam really is visually and technically impressive.

Anna’s Art Jam was a very fun one. She created a very interactive and stimulating experience. The user must pick a randomized deck of cards and will either win or lose based on the results of the images present on the card faces. Not only did Anna import sprites to use as the images for her cards, she designed and drew them herself. For a creative computation class, you can’t get more on the nose than that. Her code was a little clumsy, but she managed to get everything working flawlessly which was super impressive. Anna’s game is fun, adorable, stimulating, and incorporates unique elements of her creative mindset. She did a wonderful job!

Sean created the most complex Art Jam that I had the pleasure of seeing. He stuck to the idea of a ‘self-portrait’, but did so in a playful and quirky way. He created pixel art of himself that is heavily customizable. Not only can any element be combined with any other, he built in animations, like blinking eyes and even an adorable mechanic that makes him dizzy if you move the mouse around too much. This shows an impressive amount of knowledge and skill. He built pixel art directly into the code without importing it, which is a feat onto itself. But to go even further, he animated it, and added customizability. Sean’s Art Jam is just awesome and sticking to the criteria of ‘self-portrait’ was a nice touch.

Another noteworthy Art Jam was Edmond’s. Edmond made something that truly screamed abstract and artsy. He too kept the theme of ‘self-portrait’ but integrated it in a fascinating way. He created circles that each displayed a part of his face. The circles spin around the canvas using trigonometry.  Which in my mind, only makes the Jam cooler, since trigonometry is so cool. When the mouse hovers any circle, the screen adopts an effect, or something unexpected happens. Some pieces grow/shrink, some blur the screen, etc. Edmond’s art jam felt creative but clean and distinguished. It has a certain level of refinement that I really appreciated, since the functionality doesn’t necessarily reflect that. It’s just a truly amazing project that feels like it strongly embodies someone who’s really passionate about art.


Overall, every Art Jam that I saw was fun, creative, and unique. The other Art Jam’s were great too, but these one’s were my favourites! Everyone did a great job, and I hope others enjoyed my silly little Art Jam as much as I did theirs.
