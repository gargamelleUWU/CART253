Let me start by stating how incredibly diverse and creative all the Art Jam assignments were. I was absolutely blown away by some of the projects I saw. Some people displayed impressive technical skills that really shined through the intricacy and complexity of their work, while others showed amazing creativity and innovative thinking.

Dylan’s Art Jam instantly stood out to me. He created a beautiful scene that didn’t just look great but was also technically sophisticated. The parallax scrolling effect he used to create a sense of depth showed a solid grasp of animation logic and layer movement. His use of random generation for the trees and stars gave the piece variety and made it feel alive. The interactive meteor shower was another clever touch — it added a playful, dynamic element that showed how code can respond to user input in creative ways. A mouse click sends out a swarm of meteors through the sky, yet before and after the click, meteors appear naturally, and the click doesn’t interfere with their default loop. I don’t fully understand the depth of all the elements in Dylan’s project, as it was quite intensive. Even he pointed out some nuances of the program that I never would have noticed. His trees made use of random generation, which, over time, became less random, forcing them to spawn at predetermined rates. Overall, Dylan’s project was both visually stunning and technically sharp despite this minor short coming.

Anna’s Art Jam was a completely different experience. Unlike Dylan’s, which was more atmospheric and narratively driven, Anna’s project was a fun, interactive game full of personality. Her card game design showcased a clear understanding of user interaction and randomness. She incorporated both keyboard and mouse interactions. I have pretty good insight into Anna’s project since I helped her debug a few issues in her code. Unrelated, but helping her tweak her code was fun and insightful. Anna made liberal use of if conditions to achieve her desired results, which made the program a little clumsy at first. However, she got the code working perfectly by streamlining some of her conditions and adding additional constraints on how the cards were generated. When she first showed it to me, all three cards generated the same sprite, and did so as soon as the cards were loaded — meaning the faces were predetermined before the user actually picked one. This “flaw” didn’t affect the overall functionality, especially since users wouldn’t know how the card generation was being handled. Still, Anna fixed this issue and made the game feel far more chance-based by allowing players to truly choose one of three cards each time they were face down. On top of that, she designed and drew her own sprites, showing strong artistic commitment, and integrated those assets into the program seamlessly. I really enjoyed this one, and I’m glad Anna took the time to make sure her code ran exactly as she envisioned it.

Sean created the most complex Art Jam that I had the pleasure of seeing. He stuck to the idea of a “self-portrait,” but did so in a playful and quirky way. He created pixel art of himself that was heavily customizable. No matter which combination you chose, the pixel art was properly formatted. This is because Sean didn’t import the pixel art as an asset — he built it directly using the language. I believe he cleverly used loops to generate “pixels” where he needed them, assigning the appropriate colors after building the general shape. I also know he used symmetry to cut his workload in half. This kind of thinking is exactly what makes a great programmer. Sean went above and beyond, even adding animations such as blinking eyes and a dizzy mechanic that triggers when the mouse is moved too quickly. This shows an impressive amount of knowledge and skill, both creatively and technically. Sean’s Art Jam was just awesome, and sticking closely to the “self-portrait” criteria was a nice touch.

Another noteworthy Art Jam was Edmond’s. He made something truly abstract and artsy. He, also stuck to the theme “self-portrait” but integrated it in a unique way. He created circles that each displayed a part of his face. The circles spun around the canvas using trigonometry — which, in my mind, only makes the Jam cooler since trigonometry is awesome. Edmond used sine and cosine functions to make the pieces of his self-portrait rotate around the screen at different rates. He also made use of detection mechanics that applied filters to the screen when a circle was hovered over. Since the circles moved around the screen, it shows that Edmond has a solid grasp of how to properly use variables, as the mouse’s location was constantly compared to that of the moving circles, only turning on the filters when the mouse is over a cricle. I didn’t get a good look at Edmond’s actual code, but it clearly made heavy use of mathematics — something not necessarily expected in art — showing how math can drive artistic motion. The hover effects added a nice sense of interactivity to the program. However, I noticed that these filters and effects couldn’t coexist, and some took precedence over others. That may have been intentional, but personally, I would’ve loved to see how those effects could overlap, enhancing the meaning of the circles’ syncopated patterns and user interactions. Still, Edmond’s work was balanced, visually experimental, and cohesive.

Overall, every Art Jam I saw was fun, creative, and unique. The other projects were great too, but these were my favorites! Everyone did a fantastic job, and I hope others enjoyed my silly little Art Jam as much as I enjoyed theirs.
